                <p>
                I like to build cool stuff with <strong>Vue</strong>, <strong>React</strong>, <strong>Unity</strong>, and sometimes my sewing machine. In a past life, I studied medieval philosophy at the University of Cambridge.

                I'm a <strong>driven</strong> and <strong>passionate</strong> creator who is not afraid of trying new things. Whatever the project, I'll bring on my good mood and a little extra pizzazz. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Got a project you need help with? Want to know more about twelfth century philosophy? Wish you had someone to share raccoon memes with? Don't be a stranger, drop me a message! ðŸ’Œ
